## Blocked
<!-- Format: - Txx: <problem>, what was tried, what is needed. Remove the line when it's resolved. -->

## Next
<!-- Follow-up ideas found during tasks that are out of the current task's scope. -->
- (T02) Lecturer write/read endpoints (open/close session, overrides, roster, CSV exports) don't check the lecturer teaches that occurrence — NFR-04; fix with T31/T33 and add cross-lecturer tests (`other_lecturer_client` fixture exists).
- (T02) `POST /lecturer/sessions` as admin (no Lecturer row) sets `lecturer_id=0` → FK error/500; decide whether admins may open sessions.

## Log

### T00 — Setup — 2026-11-08
- Changed: FR/NFR/UC docs rewritten for M1/M3/M4/M8 (commit 646f1c0); CLAUDE.md loop rules; PLAN.md; hooks, reviewer agent, /next-task, scripts/run-tasks.sh.
- Decisions: Moodle login + auto-create accounts, local admin; face self-enrolment verified against the matric card (local OCR); Present/Absent only; mod_attendance sync; Pi does detection, server does recognition; M8 quiz-based features deferred.
- Tests: 12 KB unit tests passing at start.
- Next: T01.

### T00b — Web and admin decision — 2026-11-09
- Decisions: lecturer app also runs in a browser (Expo web); small admin role with web-only screens inside it; `frontend/admin` retired after T22, T46, T96, once Shino confirms (T95).
- Changed: PLAN.md adds T05, T22, T93, T95, T96 and edits T03, T46, T89; CLAUDE.md gets the web direction and "Merging to main"; new `/prepare-merge` command.
- Next: T01.

### T00c — Week 7 priority — 2026-11-09
- Decisions: the student AI chat screen must be ready for the Week 7 demo, so T80, T93, T84, T89 now run right after the T04 checkpoint (PLAN.md section 0b). Dependencies are unchanged.
- Next: T01.

### T01 — Test + lint baseline — 2026-11-09
- Changed: `backend/pytest.ini` (markers, `asyncio_mode=auto`, `pythonpath=.`), `requirements-dev.txt`, `tests/conftest.py`, `tests/test_db_baseline.py`; unused imports removed (10 files); `app/core/config.py` comments re-saved as UTF-8.
- Decisions: `db` tests use `smartclass_test` (from DATABASE_URL, or TEST_DATABASE_URL; name must end `_test`), dropped/recreated + `alembic upgrade head` once per session, TRUNCATE after each test; role clients use `create_access_token` directly; `live`/`moodle` auto-skip in conftest when LLM_API_KEY / MOODLE_TOKEN empty.
- Interface/schema changes: none. Tests: 17 passing (12 KB + 5 db); `ruff check .` clean; check.sh passes (needs docker postgres up).
- Next: T02, T03.

### T02 — Characterisation tests — 2026-11-09
- Changed: `tests/conftest.py` adds `classroom` (CS101 + 3 enrolled students, CS202 for another lecturer) and `other_lecturer_client`; new `tests/test_char_{auth,sessions,attendance,face_review}.py` (28 tests).
- Decisions: tests pin current behaviour as-is (e.g. session CSV exports missing records as "absent"; face-review closest match stores users.id). No production code changed; 2 pre-existing bugs logged under Next.
- Interface/schema changes: none. Tests: 33 `db` passing, check.sh 45 passing; reviewer PASS.
- Next: T03.

### T00d — Plan corrections while the loop runs — 2026-11-09
- Decisions (Yew Sing): four attendance statuses, replacing Present/Absent only. Defaults: Late after 15 min from session open; Late counts as attended; Excused is lecturer-only and left out of the rate. Admins use the browser only.
- Changed: FR-103, FR-302–FR-304, FR-306, FR-308, UC-M3/M4; PLAN.md T13, T30–T33, T35, T38, T39, T41, T43, T44, T99; new checkpoints T94, T23, T48 that stop the loop.
- Next: continue the plan.
